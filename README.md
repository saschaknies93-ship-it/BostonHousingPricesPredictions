Live Demo: https://bostonhousingpricespredictions-wj7h6mshmt4wdvn4xnhssr.streamlit.app/

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting housing prices.
It covers data exploration, model development, evaluation, and optimization using multiple algorithms.
The focus of this project is not only on model performance, but also on understanding model behavior, preventing overfitting, and identifying key drivers of housing prices.

🎯 Business Problem
Accurately estimating housing prices is essential for:

real estate platforms
property valuation
investment decisions

This project builds a predictive model that estimates housing prices based on structural, environmental, and socioeconomic features.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

📊 Workflow

1. Data Exploration
Analyzed dataset structure and distributions
Identified key variables influencing price

2. Baseline Model
Implemented Linear Regression
Established initial performance benchmark (~0.66 R²)

3. Feature Engineering & Scaling
Included multiple input features
Applied standardization to improve model stability

4. Model Development
Linear Regression
Simple and interpretable
Limited by inability to capture non-linear relationships

Decision Tree
Captured non-linear patterns
Achieved strong performance (~0.88 R²)
Showed overfitting (train score ≈ 1.0)
Random Forest (Final Model)

Ensemble of multiple decision trees
Reduced overfitting
Achieved best performance (~0.89 R²)

📈 Results
Model	Test R²	Train R²
Linear Regression	~0.66	~0.67
Decision Tree	~0.86–0.88	~1.00
Random Forest	~0.89	~0.97

🔍 Model Evaluation
Compared train vs test performance to detect overfitting
Visualized predicted vs actual values
Identified systematic prediction errors in linear models

🧠 Feature Importance
The most influential features were:
rm → number of rooms (strong positive impact)
lstat → socioeconomic status (strong negative impact)
Additional features contributed to fine-tuning predictions.

⚖️ Model Optimization
Controlled model complexity using hyperparameters
Balanced bias vs variance
Reduced overfitting while maintaining performance

💡 Key Learnings
Simple models provide a useful baseline but have limitations
Non-linear models significantly improve predictive performance
Ensemble methods enhance stability and generalization
Feature selection impacts both performance and interpretability
There is a critical trade-off between model complexity and overfitting
